# Tokenomics

The Fact Finance project **does not have** its own token launched (yet). Our current focus is on delivering reliable and decentralized data solutions to blockchain ecosystems.

We provide access to our Open Oracle under a freemium model, allowing users to access essential data feeds for free, with premium features or custom integrations available as paid services.

### Payments

When payments are required, they can be made using:
- Native Tokens: Payments in the native tokens of supported blockchains.
- Fiat Currency: Traditional payment methods via invoicing and contractual agreements.

This flexible and sustainable approach ensures that projects of all sizes can seamlessly integrate and benefit from Fact Financeâ€™s data solutions while maintaining transparency and scalability.
