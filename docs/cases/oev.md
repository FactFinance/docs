# Oracle Extractable Value (OEV)

Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) refers to the value that can be captured or extracted by an oracle or its operator due to its privileged position in providing data to smart contracts. Since oracles supply critical off-chain data (e.g., asset prices, interest rates, or events) to blockchains, their ability to influence or control the timing and accuracy of data updates creates potential risk for manipulation, or exploitation to make profit.

OEV is analogous to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in blockchain transactions, where miners or validators extract profits by prioritizing or reordering transactions. Similarly, in the context of oracles, operators can exploit their role to extract value by strategically delaying or manipulating the delivery of data.

## How OEV is Extracted

Oracles may extract value in several ways

### Timing Manipulation
Oracles can delay or accelerate the delivery of price updates or other critical data to create arbitrage opportunities.
>Example: If the price of ETH is rapidly increasing, an oracle may delay updating a lending protocol to allow the operator to liquidate undercollateralized positions at outdated prices.

### Front-Running Liquidations
Oracles supplying price feeds to lending protocols may front-run liquidation opportunities by triggering a liquidation themselves or prioritizing certain users’ transactions.
>Example: An oracle updates a price feed, sees an undercollateralized position before the network does, and acts on the liquidation opportunity.

### Providing Biased Data
Centralized or poorly secured oracles may intentionally skew data to benefit specific entities or extract value.
>Example: An oracle reports an artificially low price for a token to enable cheaper purchases or profitable arbitrage.

### Leveraging Off-Chain Insights

Oracles with access to off-chain market data or trade activity can exploit this information for personal gain before supplying it to the blockchain.
>Example: An oracle operator trades based on off-chain market movements that have not yet been reflected on-chain.

### How Oracles Mitigate OEV Risks

The potential for OEV makes oracle design and governance critical to maintaining trust in blockchain ecosystems. Several strategies help mitigate OEV risks:

### Decentralized Oracle Networks
Using multiple independent data providers ensures no single entity has control over the data, reducing the risk of manipulation.
>Example: Oracles  aggregate data from numerous sources and nodes, minimizing the likelihood of collusion.

### Data Aggregation
Combining data from various sources reduces the impact of errors or bias from any single source.
>Example: A price oracle may use data from multiple exchanges to calculate a weighted average price for an asset.

### Transparency and Open Auditing
Requiring oracles to publicly log data updates and decision-making processes increases accountability.
>Example: Proof-of-reporting mechanisms allow anyone to verify the accuracy and timeliness of oracle updates.

### Cryptographic Proofs
Using cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs ensures data authenticity and prevents tampering.
>Example: An oracle provides a hash of the data it processes, allowing smart contracts to verify its validity without seeing raw data.

### Slashing Mechanisms
In staking-based oracle networks, operators may lose their staked tokens for providing incorrect or malicious data.
>Example: A node operator may be penalized if it supplies inaccurate price feeds.

### Incentive Alignment
Aligning oracle operators’ rewards with honest and timely data delivery reduces their incentive to exploit OEV.
>Example: Operators earn more fees by maintaining a long-standing reputation for accurate data provision.

## Use Cases Affected by OEV

OEV risks can arise in multiple DeFi use cases, including:

   |   
---|---
Lending Protocols | Timely and accurate price feeds are essential for fair liquidations and collateral management.
Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) | Price manipulation via oracles can lead to unfair trades or arbitrage opportunities.
Prediction Markets | Manipulating event outcomes or reporting delays can undermine the integrity of market resolutions.
Stablecoins | Oracles supplying collateral valuations for stablecoins could introduce instability by delaying or falsifying data.

## Why OEV Matters

Understanding and mitigating Oracle Extractable Value is essential because:

- Trust in Oracles: Users and developers must trust that oracle data is accurate, timely, and unbiased.
- DeFi Ecosystem Integrity: OEV exploitation undermines fairness and security, threatening the long-term sustainability of DeFi.
- Economic Efficiency: Reducing OEV minimizes unnecessary costs and ensures efficient market operations.

By designing oracles with robust decentralization, transparency, and accountability, blockchain ecosystems can reduce OEV risks and maintain trust in their financial infrastructure.
