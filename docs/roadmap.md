# Roadmap

At Fact Finance, innovation is at the core of what we do, driven by the evolving needs of our clients. However, when we find time, we focus on building solutions for tomorrow. In our innovation lab, we explore ideas that expand the boundaries of blockchain utility and oracle services.

## Hereâ€™s a list of experimental projects currently under development:

### 1. ZK Privacy
- What It Is:
Leveraging Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to enable secure and private credit scores and personal data verification.
- Why It Matters:
Provides privacy-preserving solutions for DeFi protocols that need to validate user financial information without exposing sensitive data.
- Use Case:
Lending protocols using ZK to assess credit scores without revealing user identity or raw data.

### 2. LLM Service
- What It Is:
Off-chain computation of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide advanced AI services for smart contracts.
- Why It Matters:
Enables smart contracts to leverage AI-powered decision-making, summarization, or sentiment analysis without the overhead of on-chain computation.
- Use Case:
A lending protocol queries an LLM for off-chain risk assessments or news sentiment analysis to manage collateral exposure.

###  3. Math Library
- What It Is:
Development of a library of the most commonly used mathematical and economic functions to provide them as a service for smart contracts.
- Why It Matters:
Improves security and cost-efficiency by centralizing and optimizing complex calculations that are costly to replicate on-chain.
- Use Case:
Stablecoins and financial DApps using pre-verified economic models (e.g., interest rate calculations, amortizations) via oracle queries.

### 4. Trigger Scheduler
- What It Is:
A service to automate external triggers required to execute actions on the blockchain, such as payments or events based on real-world data.
- Why It Matters:
Blockchain transactions require external triggers. This tool ensures automated execution of actions at predefined intervals or conditions.
- Use Case:
Automatic payment of DeFi loan interest every month, triggered by the oracle using external schedules and verified data.

### 5. Human Verification
- What It Is:
A service providing human verification to validate data that cannot be fully automated, such as government records, legal registrations, or complex real-world events.
- Why It Matters:
Some Proof-of-Reserve (PoR) processes require manual validation to ensure accuracy and regulatory compliance.
- Use Case:
Real estate tokenization platforms requiring human verification of property registration documents before issuing on-chain proofs.

## Our Vision for the Future

These projects reflect our commitment to pushing blockchain innovation while solving practical challenges faced by our clients. By blending privacy, automation, and scalability, Fact Finance aims to create tools that bridge real-world needs with blockchain efficiency.
