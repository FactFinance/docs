# Run a Node

At Fact Finance, our mission is to transform centralized data—trusted for its accuracy and reputation—into a more decentralized and transparent system. To achieve this, we have created a node infrastructure that uses the Proof of Authenticity mechanism to securely update the blockchain with data sourced from official providers.

## Who Can Participate?

We invite the following organizations to participate in running Fact Finance nodes:
- Research Institutes: Contribute verified, high-quality data to our ecosystem.
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs): Leverage your infrastructure to support decentralized data delivery.
- Technology Companies: Join the network and help ensure reliable, decentralized data feeds for blockchain applications.
